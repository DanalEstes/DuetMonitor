# DuetMonitor
ESP8266 and OLED based monitor for Duet / RepRap based 3D printers

Intended to run on an "all in one board" like https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32819513410.html
If the link goes dead, the board has an ESP8266, a 0.96 Oled based on SSD1306 or SSH1106 controller, a 18650 single cell battery (with charger on board, micro usb)

Should be easy to adapt to other Oled boards.
